# Tudspek: Two Dimensional Spectral Kit

Tudspek is a Python 3 package that integrates a range of tools for advanced two-dimensional spectral analysis. It streamlines the process of spectral extraction, employs PCA for robust sky subtraction, providing researchers with a comprehensive framework to analyze complex spectral data.

## Features

- **Spectral Extraction:**  
  Tools designed to accurately extract spectral data from raw two-dimensional observations.

- **PCA Sky Subtraction:**  
  Implements Principal Component Analysis techniques to effectively subtract sky background noise, enhancing data quality.

## Installation

Install Tudspek locally using the following command:

```bash
pip install -e .
```
